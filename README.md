# Texas hold 'em engine in JavaScript (ECMAScript 6)

## Plan?
 * An poker game engine in JavaScript, will try to use ECMAScript 6 to simply codes.
 * A Stupid build-in AI.
 * A text based Web UI.
 * A backend API set.
 * A canvas based Web UI.
 * Make it a service.

## Why ECMAScript 6
 * I don't need the advantages in TypeScript, yet.
 * I prefer to write as less code as possible.
